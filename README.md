# In-Between Card Game Engine (C++)

A C++ implementation of the card game In-Between featuring deterministic shuffling, basic AI decision-making, and robust rule enforcement. The project emphasizes object-oriented design, testability, and memory-safe execution.

## Features
- Deterministic gameplay via seeded randomization for reproducible runs
- AI decision-making with consistent betting behavior across identical seeds
- Modular OOP design planned with UML diagrams (UMLet)
- STL usage for managing game state and collections
- Unit tested using Google Test
- Memory safety validated with Valgrind (zero leaks under test runs)

## Build & Run
This project is designed for Unix-based environments (macOS/Linux) and works in GitHub Codespaces.
